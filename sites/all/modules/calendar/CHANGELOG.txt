=======================
Version 7.x-1.0-alpha3
=======================

Argh! Fixing the field handling broke the handling for system dates. Try again.

=======================
Version 7.x-1.0-alpha2
=======================

Views made lots of changes to field handling just before the new release, which broke lots of things here. 
Adding some work-arounds to get things working again and waiting until the dust settles on how the new core fields will be handled in Views before doing much more with the Views integration. These changes should get things working with latest Views release.

=======================
Version 7.x-1.0-alpha1
=======================

Initial release, probably still buggy.
